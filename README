OVERVIEW

This is a pet project to revive an old project, addressing many issues and hopefully giving it some life.  It was built as a real time statistics tracking tool for large content producers, however despite providing very useful information in a simple manner (and in a timely fashion), due to the size of the data involved and relatively cheaper solutions filling a similar niche, it hit a big dead end.  The aims are to make it extremely light weight without losing too much functionality and improve its extensibility, provide an easy to access API, and make it something that a user could pick up and deploy to Heroku very simply.

None of this is possible right now.  There is a huge code base rewrite that is just in its infancy.

DEVELOPMENT SETUP

0) bundle install

1) Create development / test databases:
> rake db:create:all

2) Create dev partition tables:
> rake writer_partition:create column=page
> rake writer_partition:create column=domain 
> rake writer_partition:create column=keyphrase

2b) Create other tables:
> rake db:migrate

3) Create test data (need to start memcached on your machine first):
> memcached
> rake dev_seeds:fill
> (kill memcached if you want)

4) Test the dashboards for writer 1
> rails s --debug
	Visit: localhost:3000/test/1
	
DEVELOPMENT SETUP WITH TRACKING SYSTEM

1) Do the above steps

2) Start memcached:
> memcached

3) Start the redis server 
Make sure redis is installed and redis-server is in your path
> redis-server

4) Create a resque worker: 
> QUEUE=* rake resque:work

[
		To create a rescue worker with debug messages:
		> VVERBOSE=1 QUEUE=* rake resque:work

	 	To create multiple rescue workers:
	 	> COUNT=5 QUEUE=* rake resque:workers
		
 		Monitor rescue, visit: http://localhost:3000/resque - doh!
