OVERVIEW

This is a pet project to revive an old project, addressing many issues and hopefully giving it some life.  It was built as a real time statistics tracking tool for large content producers, however despite providing very useful information in a simple manner (and in a timely fashion), due to the size of the data involved and relatively cheaper solutions filling a similar niche, it hit a big dead end.  The aims are to make it extremely light weight without losing too much functionality and improve its extensibility, provide an easy to access API, and make it something that a user could pick up and deploy to Heroku very simply.

This will be a full code rewrite, and will update rails to use the asset pipeline, among other planned upgrades, and will fully utilize TDD, which was glaringly absent for the initial build.  I'll blog the process for helping others learn how it functions, URL to come soon.
